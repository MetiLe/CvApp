    <h2>Introduces some new advanced selectors</h2>
    CSS3 introduced a number of powerful selectors that can make layout cleaner by choosing DOM elements based on their attribute. So no need to specify classes and ID’s for every elements.
    <h2>Rounded corners</h2>
    Rounded corners elements can spruce up a website but creating a rounded corner require to write lots of code.CSS3 introduced the border-radius property which gives you same rounded corner effects you don’t have to write all the code.
    <h2>Border image</h2>
    The property border-image allows you to specify an image to display instead of a plain solid-colored border. Is the ability to swap out a border with an image.
    <h2>Box shadow</h2>
    It allows to create a drop shadow for an element.In the earlier versions this effect was achived using repeated image around the element 
    <h2>Text shadow</h2>
    Allows to add drop shadow to the text on the web page.In the earlier version this was done using image or duplicating a text element then positioning it.  
    <h2>Animation and transition</h2>
    Transition  allows to change property values smoothly over a given duration.we can create hover or mouse down effects.
    Animation allows animation of html without java script. It allows to repeat animation. 
    <h2>Media Queries</h2>
    In order to use them we need to enclose css styles in block guarded by media rule each code of the block is activated when one or more condition are met
    <h2>3D Transformation</h2>
    CSS3 offers some powerful features to designers and developers taht can win the users if it is done with good measures.
   <h2>New background styles</h2>
    <h3>Background-clip</h3>This property defines how the background image should be clipped.
    <h3>Background-origin</h3> It determines whether the background should be placed in the padding box border or content box.
    <h3>Background-size:</h3> it indicates the size of the background image.
    <h2> fonts</h2>
    In the earlier version people used web-safe fonts which are fonts that every single computer has installed and recognizes. In CSS3  we can use special fonts those available via Google-fonts and type cast.These fonts can either be downloaded onto the server and run through the css code or accessed directly from its source via scripts.
    <h2>Columns</h2>
    Column-based layouts were notoriously difficult pull of in css. However CSS3 introduced a way to make it possible using columns rule.
    <h2> colors</h2>
    CSS3 support new colors (RBGA,HSL,HSLA) and gradient colors and allows for adjustments to opacity.
